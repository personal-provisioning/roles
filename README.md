# Personal Provisioning Roles

Collection of generic roles.

Should be used in combination with our [starterkit](https://github.com/personal-provisioning/starterkit).

Have a look at the wiki for an explanation of each role.


## Generating new Roles

When building small roles for applications / packages to install seems repetitive you might use our script to generate a new one.
Please run `npm install` (assuming you have node installed) and `npm run generateRole` to get ask all the questions you need to generate a role.
